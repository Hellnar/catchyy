# Catchyy
Catchyy is a small fun game to check how good are you at typing on the keyboard

### How to play
1. Open [Catchyy](https://catchyy.netlify.app/) in your browser.
2. Click "Start" button in the right bottom corner.
3. Each time you see the block with text - just write it down into the input section in the bottom part of the screen.
4. You have only 3 lives. Each time a block will reach the bottom of the screen - you will lose one life. Each time you will guess the word - the speed of the blocks appearance will increase.

Have fun!

## To Do
* Add greetings screen with instructions.
* Hide buttons and inputs when it's needed.
* Fix bugs with spawn, scoreboard, input.
